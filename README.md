# Quantum-Dynamic-Circuits

According to the Qiskit textbook _"A quantum circuit is a computational routine consisting of coherent quantum operations on qubits ... It is an ordered sequence of quantum gates, measurements and resets, all of which may be conditioned on and use data from the real-time classical computation."_

You might not be familiar with the last part of the definition, but it has everything to do with dynamic circuits. In this report, we will explore the concept of dynamic circuits and provide demonstrations of three notable examples: Quantum Teleportation, Iterative Phase Estimation, and Quantum Error Correction.
